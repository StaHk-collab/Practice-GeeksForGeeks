Given an integer N represented in the form of a string, remove consecutive repeated digits from it.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1224
Output: 124
Explanation: Two consecutive occurrences of 
2 have been reduced to one.

â€‹Example 2:

Input: 
N = 1242
Output: 1242
Explanation: No digit is repeating 
consecutively in N.


Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function modify() which takes the integer N as input and returns the modified integer by removing all the
consecutive duplicate occurrences in N.


Expected Time Complexity: O(LogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


Constraints:
1<=N<=10^18

Solution :

long long int modify (long long int N)
{
    long long int n = N;
    long long int temp = 0;
    long long int r;
    long long int s = 0;
    long long int t = 0;
    while(n > 0) {
        r = n % 10;
        if(r != temp)
        s = s*10 + r;
        temp = r;
        n = n / 10;
    }
    while(s > 0) {
        r = s % 10;
        t = t*10 + r;
        s = s / 10;
    }
    return t;
}
