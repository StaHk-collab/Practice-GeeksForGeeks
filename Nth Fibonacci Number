Given a positive integer n, find the nth fibonacci number. Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 1000000007.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1 
Explanation: 1 is the 2nd number
of fibonacci series.

Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 is the 5th number
of fibonacci series.


Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function nthFibonacci() which takes n as input parameter and returns nth fibonacci number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1<= n <=1000

Solution :

#define mod 1000000007

class Solution {
  public:
    long long int nthFibonacci(long long int n){
        long long int fib[n+2];
        long long int i;
        fib[0] = 0;
        fib[1] = 1;
        for(i=2;i<=n;i++) {
            fib[i] = fib[i-1] % mod + fib[i-2] % mod;
        }
        return fib[n] % mod;
    }
};
